A Mathematica notebook (.nb file, also saved as a .pdf file) for checking the  
nondegeneracy of the Andronov-Hopf bifurcations in the paper  

M. Banaji, B. Boros  
**The smallest bimolecular mass-action CRNs admitting Andronov-Hopf bifurcation**  

Also added are:
* the table (as a .pdf file) of all 86 dynamically nonequivalent networks admitting nondegenerate Andronov-Hopf bifurcation,
* the .csv file of these 86 networks, with the exceptional networks in its 87th row.
